Hi guys, sorry for this lil introduction to my code, here's the real last version I've been working on.

To have it working, download the whole thing:

- Open your magic command line and reach the folder, 
- npm install (to get the node_modules),
- Then type this command line "http-server dist/reddit" from the root folder of the project, you'll get URLs (maybe one, maybe two...):
- Grab one and you should be able to see my work! Voila

It's not completely done but I hope that you're gonna appreciate my work! Thanks

PS: In case of problems (which I don't think is gonna happen), remove the existing "dist/" folder and rebuild it via this command line "ng build --prod", then take back the instructions from the begining (just skip the npm install part).
